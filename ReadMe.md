## Development

Updates are greatly appreciated; however, this entire repository is source generated...including the words you are reading right now. Code generation requires a different workflow.  The recommended process is to create an issue with suggested edits and explanation.  If the changes are applicable to some or all protocols, we will update the model and regenerate.

|Protocol Count | Generated Lines|
|--- | ---|
|45 | 25,647|

Note: Our dissector model is still under rapid development.

## Testing

Please report any errors as issues.  Include a small note on the protocol and version, and a minimal capture demonstrating the problem. Also consider including a link or pdf specification documenting the correct behavior.

Production captures are required for protocol verification.  If your organization has the rights to donate captures, and you wish to make the world a better place, please contact us.
